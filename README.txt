README - SSO Prototype

This project is an SSO/Single-Sign-On prototype to resolve user interaction issues with UI/UX and nail down some of the scripted elements as well as markup choices going forward.

This leverages Jquery as it is ubiquitous on the platform currently, but a Vanilla version could be useful and platform independent.
